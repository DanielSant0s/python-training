I decided to do the advanced version of the sockets activity, which uses threads. 
Despite not having been taught, I used the concurrent programming feature called mutex, 
which allows to lock threads while data is not available.

chat.py: Contains package imports and basic send and receive functions for communication
caesar_cipher.py: Enconding functions required on the activity
server.py: Server script
client.py: Client script
